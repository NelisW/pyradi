## Notes

- pyradi is no longer supported on PyPI, please install directly from this repository (details below).

- Setting up and getting to know pyradi requires some grit on your part.  The toolkit is offered as  an engineering tool to other engineers; it is not intended to be used casually by uninformed persons. Most of the documentation is written up in the code itself.  The additional documentation is relatively sparse.

- Some of the tools in pyradi are quite powerful and require careful study and insight to use correctly. Do not take shortcuts!


## Objective

The PyRadi toolkit is a Python toolkit to perform optical and infrared computational radiometry (flux flow) calculations.

The toolkit is an extendable, integrated and coherent collection of basic functions, code modules, documentation, example templates, unit tests and resources, that can be applied towards diverse calculations in the electro-optics domain. The toolkit covers

  * Models of physical radiators (e.g., Planck's Law) and conversion between values expressed in different units.

  * Mathematical operations for radiometry (e.g., spectral integrals, spatial integrals, spectral convolution)

  * Data manipulation (e.g., file input/output, interpolation, spectral quantity conversions, reading Flir Inc PTW files)

  * Detector modelling from physical parameters: including single element detectors and staring arrays

  * 3-D noise analysis of image sequences

  * Modtran tape7 read functions

  * Graphical visualization(2-D and 3-D graphs) in compact format, including cartesian, polar, image and mesh plots.

  * Spectral variables are expressed in Numpy arrays to ease spectral operations and integrals.

  * A powerful staring array sensor that accounts for various noise sources and nonlinearities.

The individual scripts in the toolkit is supported by examples, test cases and documentation. These examples are included at the end of each script in the `__main__`  section.  If you just run the script, the code will be executed and results will be available in graphs or text files.


## Prerequisites and Installation

The most recent version of pyradi was last tested in July 2019 using Python 3.7.
Python 2.7 is no longer supported (the code may still work, but it is not actively supported).

Please see this [link for installation procedures](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NelisW/ComputationalRadiometry/blob/master/00-Installing-Python-pyradi.ipynb#Installing-pyradi). It should take you to the online  nbviewer to open a notebook (`00-Installing-Python-pyradi.ipynb`) in the companion repository https://github.com/NelisW/ComputationalRadiometry.

## Learning Python

To use pyradi you would have to know Python and Numpy. Getting acquainted with a new tool or computer language takes time and practice. Invest your precious time in learning Python and its modules, you will not be disappointed!

There are many free
[books](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/),
[classes](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/),
[getting started ](http://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) blogs websites and tutorials
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEA1FEF17E1E5C0DA),  
[more videos](http://pyvideo.org/) and
[conferences](http://www.python.org/community/workshops/).  Material for Numpy is less bountiful, but the
[numpy reference](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/numpy-ref-1.8.0.pdf) and StackOverflow are good sources.
Just google some variation of 'learning python' and make your choice.

A comprehensive list of training material is given [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NelisW/ComputationalRadiometry/blob/master/02-PythonWhirlwindCheatSheet.ipynb#Learning-Python)


## Status
This project has Production status. Current content is tested, stable and usable. The scope of the pyradi is continually growing as new functionality and examples are added. 

The development is ongoing as and when new needs arise.  We are open for feature requests as well.

## Documentation
- Module documentation is available in  
- [HTML](http://nelisw.github.io/pyradi-docs/_build/html/index.html) and  [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NelisW/pyradi-docs/gh-pages/_build/latex/pyradi.pdf).
- A number of IPython notebooks demonstrate pyradi use. Head on over to
[Computational Radiometry](https://github.com/NelisW/ComputationalRadiometry) to download the notebooks. If you are not using the IPython notebook, the are also [HTML renderings](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NelisW/ComputationalRadiometry/tree/master/) in the online notebook viewer.
- At the end of each of the pyradi files, in the __main__ section, you will find test and example code demonstrating the use of that specific file. Some day, these will find their way into a tutorial, but for now, please study the example code.

## Get the code via Python pip or easy_install

**Note that pyradi is no longer available on PyPi.**

## Get the code from GitHub
You can download the very latest version of pyradi from the [pyradi repository](https://github.com/NelisW/pyradi) on GitHub.  

Note that the git checkout only installs pyradi and not any of its dependency packages matplotlib, numpy, scipy or scikit-image. 

If you install the Anaconda distribution all the dependency packages should already be present.
